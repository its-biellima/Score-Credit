Credit Analysis Application
This Python application performs a credit analysis based on financial input provided by the user. It uses Tkinter for creating a user-friendly GUI, where users can input their name, monthly income, net worth, debt, and the requested loan amount. The application then calculates a financial risk score based on predefined criteria, categorizing the risk as Low, Moderate, or High.

Features:
Collects user data through input fields.
Analyzes monthly income, net worth, debt, and loan amount requested.
Displays risk level based on the analysis.
Option to reset the inputs and perform a new analysis.
Simple and intuitive graphical interface.
Risk Analysis Logic:
Monthly Income: Categorized into low, moderate, or high income ranges.
Net Worth: Assessed relative to monthly income to determine financial stability.
Debt: Evaluated based on the user’s debt-to-net-worth ratio.
Loan Request: Compares the requested loan amount with the user's net worth and debt.
This tool can be used as a basic financial risk assessment tool or a learning project to understand how financial scoring systems work.
